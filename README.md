# SQL-data-warehouse-project
Building a modern data warehouse with SQL Server, including ETL processes, data modeling, and analytics.

# ðŸ“Š SQL Data Warehouse Project

A **comprehensive collection of SQL scripts** for data exploration, analytics, and reporting.  
This repository is designed to help **data analysts, BI professionals, and engineers** quickly explore, segment, and analyze data within a relational database.

---

## ðŸ”Ž Overview

This project contains reusable SQL scripts that cover:

- **Database Exploration** â€“ Inspect schemas, tables, and relationships.  
- **Measures & Metrics** â€“ Calculate KPIs, ratios, aggregates, and performance indicators.  
- **Time-Based Trends** â€“ Analyze daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly trends.  
- **Cumulative Analytics** â€“ Running totals, moving averages, and cumulative growth.  
- **Segmentation** â€“ Break down data by customer segments, regions, or categories.  
- **Advanced Analytics** â€“ Window functions, ranking, cohort analysis, etc.  

Each script follows **best practices** for readability, scalability, and performance tuning.


# ðŸš€ Project Requirements
##  Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)
## Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

Specifications ->
- Data Sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- Integration: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- Scope: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
